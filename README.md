# rust-cli-tic-tac-toe
This was my final project for APCSA, a course I took sophmore year of high school

In this class, we never used rust, but I thought it was an interesting programming language so
I tried it out and here is the code. If you look at the commit history, you can see the version
I submitted to the college board. That version is pretty bad and messy, so I came back to clean it
up a bit as a much more experienced rust dev. Hope you enjoy!
